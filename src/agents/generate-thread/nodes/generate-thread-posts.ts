- Keep it under 280 characters to fit in a single Tweet.
- Avoid marketing jargon or language. Don't sound like a salesperson, AI, or corporate employee.
- Do NOT use hashtags or emojis.
- Avoid the following and similar phrases, and tactics to get clicks:
  - "let's jump into this 🧵"
  - "read more below"
  - "here's what you need to know"
  - "the numbers are mind-blowing"
  - "The roadmap gets even wilder"
  - "game changing"
  Your facts and numbers should speak for themselves. Including these phrases or similar would make me want to click AWAY since it sounds like a sales pitch, or someone is grifting.
- Your post should sound like it was written by a human.`;
