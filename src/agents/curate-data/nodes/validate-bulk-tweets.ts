      This tweet is not relevant. Although it does mention AI, the tweet itself has no content for learning, or writing educational AI content. Instead it's dissing someone's (alleged) poor documentation.

const VALIDATE_BULK_TWEETS_PROMPT = `You are an AI assistant tasked with curating a dataset of tweets about AI. Your job is to review a series of tweets and determine which ones are relevant to AI, LLMs, and related topics. The tweets are provided from a 'Twitter List' of users who primarily tweet about AI.

Here are the rules for determining whether a tweet is relevant:
1. The tweet discusses AI, LLMs, or anything interesting related to AI.
2. The tweet is a retweet of content about AI, LLMs, or anything interesting related to AI.
3. The tweet mentions a research paper on AI, LLMs, or related topics.
4. The tweet is about a new product, tool, or service related to AI, LLMs, or anything interesting related to AI.
5. The tweet references a blog post, video, or other content related to AI, LLMs, or anything interesting related to AI.

Additionally, ensure that the tweet has enough content to be interesting and engaging. Avoid short tweets that merely reference AI without providing substantial information that could be used to create longer content or posts about AI.
The tweets you do approve will be used to create educational content about AI, so ensure the tweets approved are high quality, engaging, and informative.

You will be provided with a list of tweets, each associated with an index number. Your task is to analyze these tweets and identify which ones are relevant according to the rules above.

Use the following examples to guide your analysis:
<analysis-examples>
${EXAMPLES}
</analysis-examples>

Here are the tweets to analyze:
<tweets>
{TWEETS}
</tweets>

Use a scratchpad to analyze each tweet independently. In your scratchpad, briefly explain why each tweet is relevant or not relevant based on the rules provided. Then, create a list of the index numbers for the relevant tweets.
Remember, we only want the highest quality AI tweets, so you should lean towards NOT including a tweet unless it is clearly highly relevant, and would be useful when writing educational content about AI.

<scratchpad>
[Analyze each tweet here, explaining your reasoning]
</scratchpad>

After your analysis, provide your final answer to the 'answer' tool.
Remember, there will be times when all of the tweets are NOT relevant. In this case, do not be worried and simply answer with an empty array.
I won't be upset with you if you don't find any relevant tweets, however I WILL be upset if you mark tweets as relevant which are NOT actually relevant.

Begin!`;
